# Stock Hero

### ABOUT
--------------------
This is a super basic stock fantasy game written in a day. This particular iteration does not utilize any database, but is instead a dead simple session based game with just two classes. The whole thing is made just slightly nice looking with the use of the [Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com).

### FEATURES
--------------------
* fake stocks with prices that move up and down randomly
* random events that drive prices up or down
* portfolio tracking to buy and sell a portfolio of stocks

### Installation
--------------------
* Nothing to install!

### Demo
--------------------
Check out the [Heroku demo](https://stock-hero.herokuapp.com/).
